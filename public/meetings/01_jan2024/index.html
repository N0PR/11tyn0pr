<h2>2024 MACON COUNTY ARC ACTIVITIES WILL BE DISCUSSED.</h2>
<p>The members will consider share their ideas
about what the Radio Club can do to encourage
Radio Club membership and attendance at meetings
and at the Radio Club’s operating activities.
We will also discuss the possibility of adding an
operating event or two where members can practice
non-contest or special event QSOs using either their
own calls or that of the Macon County ARC.</p>
<h3>VOLUNTEER EXAM SESSIONS 2024</h3>
<p>We will also approve the dates of the Four
Quarterly Volunteer Exam Sessions at our January
meeting.</p>
<h3>ARRL FIELD DAY 2024</h3>
<p>The Club will be approving the location for
the 2024 ARRL Field Day operation and the need to
make some plans prior to the Field Day event.</p>
<h3>LESTER DENT-DOC SAVAGE SPECIAL EVENT</h3>
<p>The 2024 Lester Dent WØD special event station
operation date will be set and the members will
discuss how we can get more operators to
participate at the Round House on Saturday.</p>
<h3>RADIO CLUB FALL PICNIC</h3>
<p>The date for the Radio Club’s Fall Picnic will
be selected at the January Club meeting and any
changes that might be beneficial.</p>
<h3>ARES NET TIME PROPOSED CHANGE</h3>
<p>We are going to discuss and vote on a
proposal to change the time of the ARES Net that is
on 146.805- on Wednesday evening from 8:30 p.m.
to 7:30 p.m. Some of our members have indicated
that the earlier time would work better for them
and they think that there would be more check-ins
at the 7:30 time slot. Think about the proposal,
come to the meeting, and let your thoughts about
the change be heard.</p>
<h3>NON-CONTEST OR SPECIAL EVENT OPERATIONS?</h3>
<p>We will also consider the possibility of
adding an Amateur Radio operating event or two
where a members can practice making HF contacts
in a non-contest or non-special event mod. They
can use either their own calls or that of the Macon
County ARC NØPR. This might also be a good time
to encourage a renewed interest in Ham Radio.</p>
