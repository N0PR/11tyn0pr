JUNE 18, 2023 WORK DAY The preparation began with several Macon County ARC members going to the QTH of Dale Bagley, KØKY to check evaluate and store the equipment associated with the emergency Communications Trailer. the Triband Antenna checked, and then the Cushcraft A3S Yagi was taken apart and the trapped elements stored in a shed to protect them from rain. The rotor, coax and rotor cable were also stored in the Blue Tub in the shed. Those helping with this effort were Jesse Jones, KDØETU, Ira Huff, AI7HC, Larry Ballew, ABØHP, Chris Clark, KFØGUS, Charles, WBØHLW and Dale Bagley, KØKY.

On Field Day, June 24, 2023, Bill Schmidt, WAØJCO, brought the Tower from the Dale, KØKY’s QTH to the Macon Area Education Building.

![Sign](/img/2023fd/fd4.jpg) The Field Day Sign was strategically located to make it seen by anyone going east from the City Compost Site. Perhaps if we use the Education Building again, we might locate that sign next to the H-way 63 and Blees Industrials Dr. intersection.
