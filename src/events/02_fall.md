There was a nice turn-out of members and guests at the Macon Count Fall Picnic at Long Branch Lake. Chris Clark, KF0GUS arrived early and set-up his operating station as a POTA station. 
Larry Ballew, AB0HP, did an Excellent Job grilling the burgers and brats. There was plenty of food and good humor shared at the picnic.
